						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>I’m Nabila, and if I had to choose one word to describe myself, it would be "learner". 
						I am passionate about continuously expanding my knowledge — both within and beyond my field to create meaningful impact.
During my PhD in Chemistry, I explored novel nanomaterials using techniques like chemical vapor deposition and laser writing, 
painstakingly tailoring parameters in the techniques to tune the composition and properties of the materials. 
Collaborating with brilliant scientists and engineers, I studied these materials in-depth using state of the art techniques and 
helped apply them to real-world applications, 
such as sensors and thermoelectric devices. I have also contributed to the yield development of 2nm node in the semiconductor industry, diving deep into
 gate-all-around transistors in 2nm and smaller node chips and how to address fabrication challenges that impact their yield, reliability and performance.</p>
						<p>Throughout my journey as a scientist and engineer, I have encountered and embraced failure, learning to fail fast, adapt quickly and refine my approach. 
I thrive in interdisciplinary teams, stepping up as a mentor and leader when needed. Let’s connect and innovate together!</p>
